This `demo` folder provides two sample applications that will use the SDK package from npm:

- **React Native App**: A basic React Native project demonstrating how to integrate and use the Bucketeer React Native SDK in a standard React Native environment.
- **Expo App**: A simple Expo project showing how to use the Bucketeer React Native SDK with Expo.

Use these examples to check how to set up, configure, and interact with the Bucketeer SDK in your own projects. Each example includes its own README and setup instructions.
